# Tailwind CSS Is Ltr Mode

## Installation

```
npm install tailwindcss-is-ltr-mode --save-dev
```

Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your Tailwind configuration.

```javascript
plugins: [
  require('tailwindcss-is-ltr-mode')()
]
```

## Usage

Styles generated by this plugin are only used if the selector is applied to the `<html>` element. How you do that is up to you. `prefers-dark.js` is provided as an option, which is a simple script that enables dark mode based on the user's system theme.

### Available Variants

Variants for ltr mode are based on [Tailwind's own variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/state-variants/)...

- `isLtr`


... and are used in the same way.

```html
<div class="bg-white isLtr:bg-black">
  <p class="text-black isLtr:text-white">

  </p>
</div>
```

### Enabling Variants

As with existing variants such as `hover` and `focus`, variants for dark mode must be enabled in your Tailwind configuration for any utilities that need them.

```javascript
variants: {
  backgroundColor: ['isLtr'],
}
```

### Changing the Selector

By default, `.mode-dark` is used as the selector for dark mode. You can change this by adding the `darkSelector` key to the `theme` section in your Tailwind configuration.

```javascript
  theme: {
    isLtrSelector: '.is-ltr'
  }
```


## PurgeCSS

If you are using PurgeCSS, you should either add the selector to the `whitelist` array...

```javascript
whitelist: ['is-ltr']
```
